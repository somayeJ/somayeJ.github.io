## Joint Modelling of Dialog Acts and Sentiment Analysis using Neural Networks
This projrct started as a semester project focusing on "Twitter dialoue act modeling"  using the Twitter data. Then, we extended the project by using multi‑task techniques and framing dialog act and sentiment recognition together using the data of  Mastodon (while working as an intern in  <a href="https://synalp.gitlabpages.inria.fr/synalp-website/">Loria, SyNaLP Team</a>, under the supervison of Christiphe Cerisara).





## EMOTEX: Detecting Emotions in Twitter Messages using Neural Networks

This project which was done in university of Malta as a semester  focused on developing models that predict an emoji
given a tweet as a part of the  <a href="https://alt.qcri.org/semeval2018/index.php?id=tasks"> SemEval-2018.

 ## Code
Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```python
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```


## Images
